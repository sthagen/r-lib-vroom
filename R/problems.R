#' Retrieve parsing problems
#'
#' vroom will only fail to parse a file if the file is invalid in a way that is
#' unrecoverable. However there are a number of non-fatal problems that you
#' might want to know about. You can retrieve a data frame of these problems
#' with this function.
#' @param x A data frame from `vroom::vroom()`.
#' @return A data frame with one row for each problem and four columns:
#'   - row,col - Row and column of problem
#'   - expected - What vroom expected to find
#'   - actual - What it actually found
#'   - file - The file with the problem
#' @export
problems <- function(x) {
  probs <- attr(x, "problems")
  if (typeof(probs) != "externalptr") {
    rlang::abort("`x` must have a problems attribute that is an external pointer.\n  Is this object from readr and not vroom?")
  }
  probs <- vroom_errors_(probs)
  probs <- probs[order(probs$file, probs$row, probs$col), ]

  tibble::as_tibble(probs)
}
